          Hype Entertainment is a self-made business founded by Nana Agyemang-Duah and AnnRenee Nachwa. Across the years they have partnered with various companies and developed the wonderful new Scripts Treats that everyone is talking about. It is a movement based around positivity and banter aimed to help people love themselves and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hype's story started in Leicester with the help of their sponsorer Ainsley Owusu and evolved to the rest of the UK through the vast fame. It's a story of passion, dedication and commitment. The main aim of the movement is simply to bring a vibe to all types of events whether its your baby shower or 21st birthday...HYPE have got you.
        </p>
        It's about keeping it hype at every moment, it's not all about being loud- more of being confident, having fun and never letting anyone take your power from you.
